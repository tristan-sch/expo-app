## About

I created a very simple Expo App using React Native with a text, a component (a separator), a picture and some styles

## Running the app

```
cd app
npm install
expo start or npm start
```

## To open the app

```
-> download the expo app on your phone
- On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
- On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Home" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
```
